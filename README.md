# Exoanalytics-v2

This web app is a data visualizer for exoplanet data sourced from NASA's Exoplanet Archive. It allows users to explore various relationships, aggregations, distributions, and individual properties of exoplanets through interactive charts and tables.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Exploration:** Visualize exoplanet data through various charts and tables.
- **Backend Data Processing:** Data is fetched using the Table Access Protocol (TAP) from NASA's Exoplanet Archive, formatted on the backend, and sent to the frontend for visualization.
- **Caching for Performance:** Some data is cached for 24 hours to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Purpose
This is a personal project whose goals are:

- To make exoplanet data easily accessible to the average user.
- To demonstrate large-scale data fetching and caching using Next.js.
- To practice data visualization with Chart.js.
