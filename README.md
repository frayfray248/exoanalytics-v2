ExoAnalytics is a web app that displays exoplanet data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive. Data is presented in three main ways: firstly in charts, offering visualisations of trends and changes in data over time; secondly in statistics that show averages of planet properties such as mass; and thirdly, in individual planet profiles, allowing you to find and explore data for specific planets. This purpose of this project is to allow average users easily access exoplanet data as well as demonstrate data fetching and caching with large amount of data using Next JS.
